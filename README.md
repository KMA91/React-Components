## Components

## Purpose of Project

The purpose of this project to familiarize myself with component usage including sending data through props from parent components to child components.

## Quick Overview

This web application is created with create-react-app and serves as an application to test usage of components.

## Technical Overview

Components are used in React to assist in modularizing code.

There are two kinds of components in React, functional and class based components. Functional Components are simple, easy components that do not require extra features that come with class components. Class components features include usage of state, ability to handle user data, and usage lifecycle hooks.

Props are used within components. They allow data to be passed from Parent to Child components.
